<h1>Skills</h1>
<article id="Skills">
    I don't currently have commercial development skills, but as you can see, 
    I have a stack of HTML and CSS. In the future,
    I plan to create many useful projects and things and learn programming.

<h1>Education</h1>
<article id="Education">
I just graduated from high school and 
am a first year student studying for a major 
I would never have chosen :(
<p>
I think I should pick courses on Coursera or 
something else

<h1>Experience</h1>
<article id="Experience">
I actually have experience with JavaScript and React, but I didn't fully understand them. 
So I decided to learn everything from scratch, 
and I think this will deepen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and other disciplines.
